Import LNG Facilities: These facilities are designed to receive, unload, store, and regasify LNG that has been transported by ships. Import terminals are typically located in regions that do not have sufficient domestic natural gas production and need to import LNG to meet their energy demands. Once unloaded, the LNG is stored in cryogenic tanks and then converted back into natural gas through a regasification process for distribution to local pipelines and consumers.

Export LNG Facilities: These facilities are designed to liquefy natural gas and load it onto ships for transportation to international markets. Export terminals are typically located in regions with abundant natural gas resources and a need to transport it to countries that rely on LNG imports. The facility includes processes for purifying and liquefying natural gas by cooling it to extremely low temperatures, turning it into a liquid form for more efficient transportation. Once liquefied, the LNG is stored and then exported via LNG carriers to global markets.
