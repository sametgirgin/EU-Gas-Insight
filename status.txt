Idle: In the context of LNG terminals, an "idle project" refers to a terminal that has been constructed but is

such as unfavorable market conditions, operational or technical issues, delays in obtaining regulatory permits, 
strategic decisions by the operators, or the terminal being in a development or commissioning phase.
